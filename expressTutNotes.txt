1. bin / www / --> server root directory
    - Compiled code

2. public folders --> Files that are exposed and linked to the bin / root directory
    - assets
    - stylesheets
    - scripts

3. routes
    - modules 
    - class -> The data that you would find the views. (variables, methods, classes, etc)
    - data
    
4. views
    - template files -> HTML code
    - template engines 
    - views -> UI code (How it appears)
        ->hbs
    - every view template maps to a route file (you have index.hbs and index.js in your routes folder)
    - the view template is a static HTML code where we will replace values/data dynamically
    
5. app.js -> The main activity. The heart of the application. 
    - import your modules
    - add the required modules and packages etc
    - Runs the entire app
    - All modules must be required here i.e. // var orderRouter = require('./routes/orders'); 
                                                //orders.js would be the file itself 

6. Package.json -> Manages all the dependency code 
    - all dependencies 
    - scripts for starting, testing, etc
